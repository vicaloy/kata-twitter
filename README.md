This repository contains both the Android client and backend server for a simplified Twitter-like application (kata). Both projects follow Clean Architecture principles and are built using Kotlin.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Backend
- Kotlin: Backend development language.
- Ktor: Framework for building asynchronous servers and exposing RESTful APIs.
- Clean Architecture: Ensures separation of concerns with distinct layers for data, domain, and presentation logic.

### Android Client
- Kotlin: Core language for Android development.
- MVVM Pattern: Implements the Model-View-ViewModel architecture for clean separation of concerns.
- XML Layouts: For creating user interfaces.
- Retrofit: For consuming RESTful services from the backend.
